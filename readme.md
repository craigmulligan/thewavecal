## Wavecal

The Bristol wave pool calendar is hard to use because you have to view each setting page to see the times, which makes it difficult to see the days programme at a glance, which is especially useful if you are flexible with your visit and want to maximize your favourite settings.

This will script scape their site and output an ical file which you can import into your calendar software. It currently scrapes 3 months ahead, but it's run automatically.

If you need a hand running it give me a shout.

The current calendar is available [here](https://thewave.craigmulligan.com)
